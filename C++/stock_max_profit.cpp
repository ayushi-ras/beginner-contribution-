//For example: if arr is [44, 30, 24, 32, 35, 30, 40, 38, 15] then your program should return 16 because at index 2 the stock was worth $24 and at index 6 the stock was then worth $40, 
//so if you bought the stock at 24 and sold it at 40, you would have made a profit of $16, which is the maximum profit that could have been made with this list of stock prices.
